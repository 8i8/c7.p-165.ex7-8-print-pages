/*
 * K&R edition 2
 *
 * Exercise 7-8. Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one
 * on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file.
 *
 * <<< more_or_less >>>
 *
 * The program is designed to open several text files simultaneously, the user
 * can navigate these file using either the vim style nav bindings or the arrow
 * keys, j, k, <down> <up>, scroll up and down, and h, l <left> <right> jump to
 * either the next or the previous file.
 *
 * essentially the screen struct contains a char* string which is printed to
 * screen after each navigation command given, the folio struct stores each
 * file, which supplied at runtime as argv[] inputs, the textual content
 * scanned and put into memory, this is copied into the screen struct, in part
 * or in its entirety if the file is small enough, truncating any lines that
 * are longer than the screen is wide.
